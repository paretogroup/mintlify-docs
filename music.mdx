Tess AI’s Music tool lets you create original songs from natural-language prompts. You describe genre, instruments, mood, structure, and duration — and the AI generates a track ready to use in videos, presentations, podcasts, bumpers, music prototypes, and social media content.

**What is the Music Generator**

It’s a “music studio” inside the chat:

- you describe what you want to hear
- you choose (when available) the music generation model
- you generate an original track
- you refine with new instructions until you reach the ideal result

<Info>
  You don’t need to know music theory, play an instrument, or use production software. The final quality depends mainly on how clear your prompt is.

### **Available models**

Tess AI may offer different music generation models, for example:

- Minimax Music
- Google Lyria
- Stability Music
- ElevenLabs Music

Each model tends to have a different “signature” (timbre, style, vocals, arrangement density, prompt responsiveness). To find the best sound for a project, it’s worth testing the same prompt in 2 models and comparing.

### **Use cases**

- Custom background tracks for videos and lives
- Bumpers and jingles (brand, product, campaign)
- Music for institutional presentations
- Prototypes of musical ideas (melody, groove, mood)
- Content for social media (short loops, specific moods)

**How to use the tool**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable the Tool">
    Enable it in Tess Chat, choose one of the models, and write a prompt (simple model).

    Use this formula:

    _<u>Genre + Instruments + Mood + Tempo/BPM + Duration + Structure references</u>_

    Examples:

    - “Create a soft jazz instrumental with piano, bass, and drums, melancholic, 90 BPM, 60 seconds.”
    - “Minimalist electronic track, synths and dry kick, futuristic atmosphere, 120 BPM, 30 seconds, with a short intro and a light drop.”
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask it to generate and refine the result">
    Once you get the result, keep asking for specific adjustments, for example:

    - Structure: “Make a 5s intro, then a catchy chorus, and end with a fade-out.”
    - Energy: “Make the chorus more energetic and the verse calmer.”
    - Instrumentation: “Remove the sax and add clean guitar with reverb.”
    - Mix: “Lower the drums and bring up the bass.”
    - Harmony: “In C major” or “more tense, with minor chords.”
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Tips for better prompts**

  - Be specific about the goal: “background music for a corporate video” vs “music for a party”
  - Set duration and BPM (even if approximate)
  - Say whether you want instrumental or vocals
  - Indicate mood with concrete adjectives: “intimate, soft, cinematic, tense, triumphant”
  - For social media, ask for a “loop” and an “ending that connects back to the beginning”
</Tip>

### **Prompt Examples for Music**

- Corporate “Modern corporate instrumental track, light piano and pads, inspiring and discreet, 100 BPM, 45 seconds, no vocals, ending with fade-out.”
- Podcast “Soft lo-fi ambient, light drums with hi-hats, smooth bass, welcoming mood, 80 BPM, 60 seconds, continuous loop, no attention-grabbing melodies.”
- Short bumper “8-second bumper, electronic pop, catchy hook, 128 BPM, ending with a short impact, no vocals.”

<Warning>
  **Credits and usage**

  Music generation usually consumes more credits than text responses, because it involves audio processing. To optimize, test first with 10–20 seconds and refine the prompt before generating long versions.
