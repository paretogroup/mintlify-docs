title: "Agent Types"
---

Think of an Agent as a personalized assistant, ready to perform tasks based on your needs. It is a smart, contextualized AI configuration that plays the role of a team member (AI Workforce).

You define the instructions (the prompt), provide the necessary knowledge (such as documents and spreadsheets), and select the tools it can use. From there, the Agent can interact with various sources — such as the web, PDFs, and other AI modules — to deliver a complete and personalized result.

In Tess AI, anyone can create agents in just a few minutes, with no programming knowledge required (it is fully no-code). This makes Agents your greatest allies in automating, standardizing, and personalizing tasks.

> Practical example:

> _Instead of starting from scratch every time you need to create LinkedIn posts, you can create an Agent specialized in that task, already configured with your instructions. It will be set up with best practices for social media writing, your tone of voice, and the desired style — speeding up the process and ensuring the quality and consistency of your content._

## **Agent Types in Tess AI**

You can create different types of Agents in our Agent Studio:

  This is the most common and versatile type of Agent. Perfect for dynamic and interactive demands, where the user can continue the conversation with the Agent after the first response in order to refine the content. Chat Agents enable a fluid conversation with the AI, allowing you to refine and adjust the result with each interaction.
