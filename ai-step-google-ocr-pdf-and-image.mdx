title: "AI Step | Google OCR PDF & Image"
---

This function allows you to extract text from PDF documents or images into readable text. Using advanced OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technologies, it is possible to accurately analyze and interpret the textual content of images and PDFs, even under low-quality conditions. And with the help of AI, you can train models to use this information as references to structure summaries, analyses, and strategic materials.

  **Limitations:**

  - The conversion quality may vary depending on the quality of the original document and the complexity of the layout.
  - Training cannot exceed the token limit of the selected LLM. This can range from 10,000 to 140,000 words. Therefore, make sure the selected PDF is within this limit. If you have a PDF that exceeds the limit, consider splitting it into smaller parts.
