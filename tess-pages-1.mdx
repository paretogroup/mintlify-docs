We have made the process of publishing your website on the web simpler and faster than ever. With Tess Pages, you can create and publish your page on the platform (whether it's a landing page, a form, dashboard, presentation, etc.), using the chat itself.

Tess Pages is Tess's instant cloud feature, a solution for publishing pages with a single command.

### **What is Instant Cloud?**

Instant Cloud is the tool that transforms your files into active, accessible web pages, which we call Tess Pages. With a simple command, you can host your documents directly on the Tess AI infrastructure, generating a public link to share with whoever you want.

It is the fastest and easiest way to get your content online, with no technical knowledge required. The complexity of hosting a website has been reduced to a simple request.

### **How It Works: A Step-by-Step Guide**

The workflow is incredibly straightforward. Follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Have the HTML File">
    The first step is to have your .html file ready and available in the conversation context. You can do this in two ways:

    - Creating the file on the spot: Use the Manage Files tool to write the HTML code for a website directly in the chat.
    - Uploading an existing file: Upload your ready-made HTML file when using one of the tools that allow attachments, such as Manage Files or Deep Analysis.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate the HTML File and Refine the Result">
    Ask for the HTML file to be generated as a preview in Tess, so you can see the result as a preview and make any necessary adjustments.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request Publication">
    With the file available in the chat, simply give the AI a clear command. No complex configurations needed. Just ask.

    Command Examples:

    - "Publish this HTML file as a website."
    - "Create a Tess Page with the file my-site.html."
    - "I want to publish this website. Generate the link for me."

</Steps>

**Done! Your Website Is Live!**

The AI will process your request and provide the public link to your new Tess Page. Simple as that! Your content will be instantly accessible to the world.

<Note>
  **Important Information:**

  To ensure the best experience, keep two simple rules in mind:

  - Custom Subdomain: You are free to choose a custom subdomain for your website (e.g.: [my-amazing-project.tess.page](http://my-amazing-project.tess.page)). However, the chosen name cannot already be in use on the platform. Be creative!
  - One Website per Chat: Each chat conversation is limited to publishing a single website. If you publish a new file in the same chat, it will replace the previous website. To publish a second website, simply start a new chat.
