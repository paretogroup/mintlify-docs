<Card title="System Status">

  The System Status shows, in real time, the operational health of the Tess AI platform:

  - Current uptime (service availability)
  - Ongoing incidents or recent history
  - Performance of APIs and main features

    />
  </Frame>
  **Why access the System Status?**

  If you're experiencing slowness or an error, you can check whether it's a general or local issue and have transparent visibility into incidents (start, resolution, impact).
</Card>

In summary, Data Controls ensure full transparency about how Tess protects your data (Trust Center) and keeps the platform running with high availability (System Status). 

Access it whenever you need to verify security, assess compliance, or check if there is any ongoing incident.
