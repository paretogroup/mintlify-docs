## Our Model Integration Policy

A common question concerns the security of using the different Artificial Intelligence models available on Tess AI.

Our policy is clear: privacy is non-negotiable. The full data security and privacy that Tess offers is one of the main factors considered by our clients, especially enterprises.

- <u>Certification and Security:</u> We only integrate AI models into our platform that hold recognized security certifications, such as SOC 2, and that contractually guarantee data privacy.
- <u>Additional Security:</u> Using an AI model, such as DeepSeek, through Tess is safer than using it directly (in its free version). We ensure that the models run on our own infrastructure in a secure way, without sharing your data.

## Enterprise Contracts

For models from major providers, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, we operate under enterprise-level agreements (Enterprise). This means your data is protected by the same security and confidentiality agreements that safeguard large global corporations. Any API integration is governed by these terms, ensuring that your information is not used for model training.

## Secure Data Analysis with Deep Analysis

The Deep Analysis tool available in the chat and in agent creation was developed to enable analysis of large volumes of data without compromising security or accuracy.

- In the Agent:

### How does Deep Analysis work?

When using Deep Analysis, the AI is connected to a secure virtual machine (Tess Computer) that uses Python libraries to perform complex calculations and data processing.

The AI acts as an interpreter after this processing, communicating the precise results to you, without "hallucinations", since the calculations are performed by a deterministic computational environment.

Guaranteed Privacy: You can drag spreadsheets and documents with sensitive data into the tool with the certainty that the information will remain secure and private, being used only for the requested analysis.
