When you create your account in Tess AI, the next step is to customize your Workspace. This environment is your work panel (whether individual or collective), and setting it up correctly is essential to creating an identity for your team and facilitating collaboration.

### **What is the Workspace?**

Think of the Workspace as the main profile of your account. It's the page that represents your team or your company within Tess AI. This is where you define the name, image, and information that all members and visitors will see.

### **Accessing Workspace Settings**

There are two simple paths to get to the settings screen:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card icon="1" title="Through the Workspace Menu">
    - Access your team's main dashboard.
    - Click on the "Workspace Settings" option.

      <Frame>
        ![Image](/images/image-25.png)
      </Frame>
  </Card>
  <Card icon="2" title="Through the User Menu">
    - Click on your profile icon in the lower left corner.
    - Select the "Settings" option and locate the Workspace.

      <Frame>
        <img
          src="/images/image-26.png"
          alt="Image"
          title="Image"
          style={{ width:"87%" }}
        />
      </Frame>
  </Card>
</Columns>

Both paths will take you to the same customization screen:

### **Customizing Your Workspace Information**

Now, let's fill in the fields to bring your work environment to life:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Name">
    The display name of your Workspace. It can be your company name, your team's name, or your personal name.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Username">
    The unique identifier of your profile (e.g., @your_company). It will be used in your public profile URL.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Profile Image">
    The main image that represents the account. Ideal for using your company logo or a professional photo.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Description">
    A short, impactful phrase that appears just below the name, in your profile header.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cover">
    The header image at the top of your Workspace, functioning as a banner.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Bio (Optional)">
    A space for more detailed information. The text entered here will be visible on the "About" tab of your profile.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Adding Social Media (Optional)">
    You can add links to your social media profiles or your company's. These links will appear on your profile and redirect anyone who clicks to the respective pages, centralizing your brand's points of contact.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Final Step: Save Your Changes!

After filling in and reviewing all the information, click the "Save" button. This is the most important step to ensure all your customizations are applied.

Your workspace is now set up with your team's visual identity and information. Remember that you can revisit these settings and edit whatever is needed at any time, following the same process.
