## Create an API Key[​](#create-an-api-key "Direct link to Create an API Key")

To use the Tess AI API, you'll need an API key. You can create one by:

1. Going directly to [#Tess AI → User Tokens](https://tess.im/dashboard/user/tokens)

2. Or navigating through the UI:

   * Visit [#Tess AI](https://tess.im)
   * Click on the User Menu
   * Select "API Tokens"
   * Click "Add New Token"

## Set up your API Key (recommended)[​](#set-up-your-api-key-recommended "Direct link to Set up your API Key (recommended)")

Configure your API key as an environment variable. This approach streamlines your API usage by eliminating the need to include your API key in each request. Moreover, it enhances security by minimizing the risk of inadvertently including your API key in your codebase.
