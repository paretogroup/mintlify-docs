title: "AI Step | Extract Text from Entire PDF"
---

In this tutorial, we will explain how to use the "Extract Text from Entire PDF" Step on the Tess AI platform. This step is useful for extracting text from a PDF, allowing you to use it to train your model or consult the document.

Here are the details on how to fill in the fields and examples of use cases:

> \*\*Fields to Fill In: \*\*Enter the file or PDF link — In this field, you need to provide the link to a PDF file published on the internet with open access. Alternatively, you can use the result of the "Upload File" user input to extract data from files stored on your computer.
>
> \*\*Output Result: \*\*The text from the entire PDF will be extracted.

### **Use Cases:**

1. **Contract Import for Queries:** Imagine you have a library of contracts in PDF format. Using the "Extract Text from Entire PDF" Step, you can extract the text from all of these contracts and create a search model that allows users to look up specific terms within the contracts. This is useful for quickly locating important information.
2. **Knowledge Base Import for Consultation:** If you have a knowledge base in PDF format, you can use this step to extract the content from all documents and make it available in a consultation system. Users can then search and access relevant information effectively.
3. **Document Import for Training Across Different Markets:** If you are training an AI model for a specific market, such as the financial, legal, or medical sector, you can use the "Extract Text from Entire PDF" Step to collect data from relevant PDF documents. This data can be used to train the model and improve its understanding of the market, allowing it to provide more accurate and contextual information.

  **Limitations:**

  It is important to keep in mind that training your AI based on PDF documents extracted through Tess AI has a size limitation.

  The training cannot exceed 80,000 words. Therefore, make sure the selected PDF is within this limit. If you have a PDF with more than 80,000 words, consider splitting it into smaller parts or selecting only the most relevant sections.

  Otherwise, it is better to use the agent creation mode by adding the file as RAG.

The "Extract Text from Entire PDF" Step is a powerful tool that enables text extraction from PDFs for various purposes — from contract queries to model training across different sectors. It simplifies the process of obtaining data from PDF documents and makes it easier to use that data in your workflow.
