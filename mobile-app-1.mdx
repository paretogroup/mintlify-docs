The Tess AI app is the mobile version of the platform, available for Android smartphones and tablets (Google Play Store) and iPhone or iPad (App Store).

You use the same account as the web version, with access to the same workspaces, agents, conversations, and main features.

## How to log in to the app

1. Step 1 – Open the app

Tap the Tess AI icon on your phone/tablet. On the first launch, you will be taken directly to the welcome/login screen.

2. Step 2 – Enter your credentials

For those who already use Tess AI on the web:

- Enter the same email and password you use on the web version
- If available, you can also sign in with your Google account

For new users:

- Tap "Create account"
- Fill in the required information
- Confirm your registration and then log in normally

### I forgot my password. What now?

- On the login screen, tap "Forgot my password".
- You will receive an email with instructions to reset your password.
- After creating the new password, go back to the app and log in again.

### Requirements and recommendations

1. Internet connection: The Tess AI app requires an active connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data) to work properly.
2. Storage space: Make sure your device has enough free space to install and update the app.
3. Notifications: You can enable app notifications in your phone's settings to receive important alerts, follow updates, and be notified of relevant events in your account.

### How the app works (compared to the web version)

The mobile experience is very similar to the web version, with an interface adapted for touch and smaller screens.

In the app, you can, for example:

- chat with text models in the chat
- use your agents
- use image, audio, video, music, and other tools directly from the chat
- access conversation histories and results, and much more

In summary: everything you already do on your computer, you can now do "in your pocket", with the same account and the same main features.
