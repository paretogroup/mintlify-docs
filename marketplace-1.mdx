title: "Marketplace"
---

Tess's Marketplace is one of the great pillars of the platform. It allows users to access thousands of agents created by the Tess community and made available to the public.

Any user can create an agent and make it public, available in the Tess Marketplace. More than that, they can activate monetization for that agent and turn it into an additional source of income.

### **What is it?**

The Marketplace is a showcase of agents ready to use. Any agent marked as Public in Visibility can appear in the Marketplace. You can filter by category, use case, language, popularity, etc.

When you find something interesting, you can test it, add it to your workspace (as a copy, if enabled by the owner), and then adapt the prompt, Knowledge Base, and settings to fit your needs.

### **Why is it important?**

5. Open the agent you want to test and use it normally.
6. For those that have the clone or purchase option enabled, if it makes sense, you can proceed and create a copy for your Workspace, where you will be able to edit everything.

  **Best practices**

  - Use the Marketplace as a starting point, not as a "set it and forget it" solution: always adapt it to your context.
  - Read the descriptions and limitations of each agent.
  - If you publish your own agents, clearly describe:
    - what it is for
    - what it does well
    - known limitations
