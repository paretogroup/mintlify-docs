At Tess AI, we offer Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality as part of our <u>Enterprise plan</u> to ensure a robust, centralized, and frictionless authentication process for your team.

### **What is Single Sign-On (SSO)?**

Imagine having a digital master key. Instead of carrying a heavy and complex keychain for every door, you use a single key to access all the environments you need. Single Sign-On (SSO) works in a similar way.

It’s an authentication technology that allows a user to access multiple systems and applications — including Tess AI — with a single set of credentials (username and password), typically managed by your company’s identity provider (such as Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, etc.).

By logging in once to your organization’s system, the user will be automatically authenticated in all integrated applications, without needing to type passwords repeatedly.

### **Key Benefits for Your Organization**

Implementing SSO goes beyond convenience, bringing strategic advantages:

1. _<u>Stronger Security:</u>_ SSO centralizes access control. This means your company’s security policies (such as multi-factor authentication, password complexity, and expiration rules) are applied consistently. In addition, the process of removing access for a former employee becomes instant and fail-safe.
2. _<u>Simplified Access Experience:</u>_ Your employees no longer need to manage dozens of different passwords. 
3. _<u>Centralized Management and Auditing:</u>_ The IT team gains full visibility and control over who accesses the platform, simplifying permission management and making it easier to generate reports for auditing and compliance purposes.

<Note>
  **Important:**

  To meet the security, scale, and governance needs of large organizations, SSO functionality is _available exclusively to Enterprise plan customers._

### **How to Enable SSO in Your Workspace**

SSO setup is a collaborative process, supported by our technical team in partnership with your company’s IT team, ensuring a secure implementation aligned with your internal policies. Typically, the activation process is quite fast, depending on the customer’s responsiveness, taking at most a few days (or less).

If you are an Enterprise customer and would like to enable SSO or have any questions about the process, contact your account manager or write to us at [<u>support@tess.im</u>](mailto:support@tess.im).
