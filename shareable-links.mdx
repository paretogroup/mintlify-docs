Tess AI allows you to share chat conversations through links, which facilitates collaboration, internal alignment, and demonstrations. There are two sharing options, accessible through the sharing icon in the upper right corner of the chat: <u>Clone Chat and Public Chat (Replay).</u>

### **Where to find it?**

- Open the chat you want to share
- In the upper right corner, click on the sharing icon
- Choose the type of link: Clone Chat or Public Chat (Replay)

### **Sharing options**

<Card icon="link" title="Clone Chat (collaborative link)">
  A link is generated that allows another person to open a copy of the chat and continue the conversation from where you left off. They will see all of your previous exchanges.

  Use it when you want collaboration on projects and need to pass the context built so far to someone to continue from their own screen. Or if you have made an internal demonstration of a flow (e.g.: prompt, service structure, script) and the result can be reused by another user on Tess.

  In short, the person can continue the chat and generate new messages based on the existing history without interfering with your screen or adapting it to their own context (without "reinventing" everything).
</Card>

<Card icon="circle-play" title="Public Chat (Replay) (view-only link)">
  A public link is created that works as a "replay" of the conversation (showing the entire exchange in an animated way). Anyone with the link can view the interaction, even without a Tess AI account.

  Use it to share a result with an external audience (e.g.: insight, tutorial, agent example), to show how Tess arrived at an output (process transparency), or even to send to a client/partner as a conversation reference (without giving editing access).

  The person will only be able to view the conversation (like a replay), so they do not need to log in to Tess to open the link.
</Card>

Sharing through both options also works if the chat has attachments in the knowledge base. It is possible to see the models used in each message, as well as the tools used during the conversation, and also whether any agent was called (via the @ feature).

<Warning>
  Warning

  Be careful if the chat contains files with important data or sensitive information (personal data, keys, private links, internal details). Before generating the shareable link, delete all such files from the chat and prevent them from being exposed through the shared link. In these cases, consider: turning it into a text-based guide (without attachments) or making the material available through a separate secure channel.
</Warning>

### Relevant use case examples:

> 1. For Sales: it is a practical way to share real Tess use cases (with the execution and the result), without needing to record a video or redo the step-by-step process.
> 2. For Marketing: it is possible to share use cases in social media posts and take the audience directly to the experience, via link, in a quick and hands-on way.
