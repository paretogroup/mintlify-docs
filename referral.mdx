### **Practical Example of Earning Potential**

Imagine you referred Tess AI to a company, and they purchased a plan with 10 licenses (seats) at a cost of \$40 per license/month.

> _Annual contract value: 10 seats x \$40 x 12 months = \$4,800_
>
> _Your commission (10%): \$480_
>
> With a single referral, you would earn \$480.

**Troubleshooting: Payment with "Returned" status**

Occasionally, a commission payment may not be completed and may appear with the status **"Returned".**

This means the payment was processed correctly by our payment partner (Cello), but it was returned by PayPal due to a pending issue with the affiliate’s own account.

The most common reasons for this are:

- The PayPal account email registered on the affiliate platform is incorrect or does not exist.
- The PayPal account has not been fully verified.
- There is some restriction or block on the PayPal account that prevents receiving funds.

> **How to fix it?**
>
> - Review your details: Check that the PayPal email registered in the affiliate dashboard is correct.
> - Check your PayPal account: Access your PayPal account and confirm there are no verification or account restriction issues. If you have questions, contact PayPal support.
> - Update the information: After fixing any pending issue, update or re-enter your payment email in the affiliate dashboard. A new payment attempt will be made automatically in the next cycle.
