### **How to Transcribe with the Generator?**

The process to transcribe an audio or video file in Tess AI is simple and intuitive. Transcription can be done in two ways: using the specialized agent (Transcription Generator) or directly in the chat, with control over language and AI model.

To use the Transcription Generator, follow the steps below:

<Steps>

  <Step title="Generate the transcription">
    Request the transcription using the “Tess, generate it for me” button. The AI agent will process the file and, in moments, deliver the full transcription directly on the screen, on the right side. From there, you can copy the text wherever you need.
