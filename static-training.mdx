In Tess, you can create multiple AI Agents. The secret to a truly effective agent aligned with your goals lies in Static Instructions, also known as the system prompt (System Prompt).

### **What are Static Instructions?**

Think of them as the "brain" or DNA of your Generative AI Agent. They are a set of guidelines, rules, and context that you provide to define how the AI will behave, what it needs to do, and how it should deliver the result to you. The persona, the objective, the task to be performed, the boundary conditions, the output format, etc. They are the foundation on which the agent will operate in all interactions, ensuring consistency and accuracy.

Unlike the questions you ask in a conversation (which are dynamic), static instructions are fixed and serve as the agent’s main source of truth.

### **Building the Perfect Prompt: The Anatomy of the Instruction**

Investing time in creating a good prompt is essential to your agent’s success. Creating an effective prompt is simpler than it seems. The key is to be clear, structured, and objective. To get the best results, follow the structure we call the "Ideal Prompt Anatomy II":

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define the Persona (Who is your Agent?)">
    Start by giving the agent an identity. Is it a marketing specialist? A financial consultant? Describe their role, seniority level, and tone of voice. Giving it a name also helps consolidate the persona.

    - Example (Formal): "You are the 'Pro Analyst', a senior technical support specialist at TechSolutions with 20 years of experience. Your communication must be formal, clear, and objective, always addressing the user as 'sir/ma’am'."
    - Example (Creative): "You are the 'Idea Master', a brainstorming specialist for marketing campaigns. Your tone is inspiring and creative, but always focused on generating innovative concepts for the team."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the Objective and Actions">
    What is the main task this agent should perform? Be specific about its functions and what it should do.

    - Example: "Your main objective is to analyze sales spreadsheets to identify the five best-selling products of the last quarter. Your actions are: request the file, confirm receipt, analyze the data, and present the results."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide the Necessary Context">
    Does the agent need information about your company, products, or policies to work? Include all relevant knowledge for the task here.

    - Example: "You work for 'Solaria', a company that sells solar energy solutions. Our main products are the 'SunPower-X' panels and the 'Volt-Master' inverter. Our warranty policy is 5 years for all components."
    - Example 2: "The reports you produce will always be reviewed by experienced investors, so the format must be executive, in a professional and sober tone."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Indicate the Response Format">
    Describe how the agent should structure its deliveries. Using clear examples here is essential to guide the AI.

    - Example: "Present your analysis in a numbered list, from best-selling to least-selling. Always start with a two-sentence executive summary before presenting the list."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Rules and Limitations">
    Provide the necessary warnings (positive or negative) for the agent—what it should always do or avoid. Do it clearly. As important as saying what to do is defining what the agent must avoid. This helps maintain focus, safety, and alignment.

    - Example: "You must not, under any circumstances, provide personal opinions or create information that was not provided. If you don’t know the answer, state that you will consult a human specialist. Never offer discounts on the products."
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  - Be Direct: Use clear language and avoid ambiguities.
  - Use First Person: Write the instructions as if you were speaking directly to the agent (e.g., "You are...", "Your task is...").
  - Test and Refine: Create a first version, test with different questions, and adjust the instructions and knowledge base as needed to improve the agent’s behavior.
</Tip>

By following these guidelines, you’ll be ready to create AI Agents in Tess AI that are not only intelligent, but also perfectly aligned with your vision and needs.
