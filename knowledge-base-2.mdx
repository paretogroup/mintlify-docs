title: "Knowledge Base"

The Knowledge Base in Settings is the "central bank" of all files sent to Tess AI: uploads made in chats, agents, flows, and other areas of the workspace.

Here you can track who uploaded what, when, how many credits are consumed, and where each file is being used.

**How to access it?**

<Step title='Log in to your Tess AI account and then click on your profile icon, located in the lower left corner of the screen. In the menu that opens, select the "Settings" option.'>

### **What is this Knowledge Base about?**

It's the global file repository of the workspace (images, PDFs, docs, etc.) sent to Tess. It's not the same as the Knowledge Base in Agent Studio (which is the content base linked to a specific agent) or in Chat (linked to that context window).

Here you can see all uploads, regardless of which agent or chat used the file.

In the panel, we see a table structure with:

- File name
- Type (e.g., Image, PDF, Document)
- Created by (who uploaded it)
- Created at (date and time)
- File size
- Credits (when there is associated consumption)
- Links (where the file was included – for example: "Tess 6", agent name, or chat name)
- Filters and search

At the top, you can:

1. Filter by attachment type (Attachment Type):
