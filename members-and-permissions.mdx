title: "Members and Permissions"
---

Think of the "Members" area as the control room for your team on Tess AI. This is where you have the visibility and power to manage who is part of your workspace, how they use the platform, and what permissions they have.

This complete guide will show you how to add, manage, and define permissions for your team members.

But before you begin — and for a better experience — make sure your workspace is already set up. If you haven't done so yet, check out our article on how to configure your workspace.

### **User Types and Permission Levels**

In Tess AI, there are different roles that you can assign to members, each with a specific set of permissions. Understanding these roles is essential for effective and secure management.
