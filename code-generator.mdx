**What can you do with the Code Generator?**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Develop Scripts and Applications">
    Describe what you need, and the AI will generate the initial code. For example: "Create a Python script that reads a CSV file and calculates the average of a specific column."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Fix Bugs (Debugging)">
    Found an error you can’t solve? Paste the problematic code snippet and ask the AI to identify and fix the issue.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Translate / Review Code">
    Easily migrate a function or script from one language to another. For example, ask it to "translate this Java code to JavaScript."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Learn and Study">
    Ask the AI to explain a concept, a function, or a complex block of code. It’s a great way to deepen your knowledge.

**Tips to Get the Best Results**

To make the most of the Code Generator’s potential, follow these best practices:

<Card title="Be Specific">
  The clearer and more detailed your request is, the more accurate the generated code will be. Specify the language, the libraries you plan to use, and the final goal.
</Card>

<Card title="Provide Context">
  When asking to fix an error, include not only the code, but also the error message you’re getting.
</Card>

<Card title="Interact and Refine">
  The chat is a dynamic environment. Use it to refine the generated code. Ask it to add comments, simplify a function, or optimize performance.
