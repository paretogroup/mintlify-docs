The Tess AI API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general:

- Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success
- Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided
- Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with our servers (these are rare)

## **HTTP Status Codes**

| **Status Code** | **Description**                                       | **Common Causes**                                        |
| :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |

| 201             | Created - The resource was successfully created       | New webhook created successfully                         |

| 429             | Rate Limited - Too many requests                      | Exceeded API rate limits                                 |
| 500             | Internal Server Error - Server issue                  | Unexpected server error (please contact support)         |

## **Error Types and Examples**

### **Authentication Errors (403)**

These errors occur when there's a problem with your API key:

```
{
  "error": "Invalid authentication"
}
```

Common causes:

- Invalid API key
- Expired API key
- Missing Authorization header
- Insufficient permissions

### **Validation Errors (400)**

Occur when the request data doesn't meet the requirements:

```
{
  "error": "Validation failed",
  "messages": {
    "url": ["The url field must be a valid HTTPS URL"],
    "method": ["The method must be one of: POST, GET"]
  }
}
```

Common validation rules:

- **Webhooks**
  - URL must be a valid HTTPS URL
  - Method must be either POST or GET
  - Status must be either "active" or "inactive"
- **Files**
  - File must be provided for upload
  - Process flag is optional (default: false)

### **Rate Limit Errors (429)**

Occur when you've exceeded the API rate limits:

```
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "retry_after": 60
}
```

### **Server Errors (500)**

Indicate an issue on our end:

```
{
  "error": "Internal server error"
}
```
