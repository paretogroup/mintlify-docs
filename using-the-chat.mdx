Tess AI Chat is the materialization of our vision for collaboration between AI models. Think of the Chat screen as your command center.

In the same interface and within the same conversation, you can switch between text models (LLMs), image, video, audio, voiceover, avatar creation, and also use other professional tools for data analysis, document creation, integrations, etc.

In other words, in a natural and fluid way, you can have hundreds of <u>models collaborating with each other</u>, which greatly increases your AI performance.

In this space, besides sending your messages to the chat and talking with the AIs, you can:

1. **Select the LLM**: Choose the ideal AI model for each task or leave it in Automatic mode so Tess can decide for you.
2. **Adjust the Temperature**: Control the level of creativity in the responses. Lower values (systematic, objective) generate more direct and factual answers, while higher values (creative, imaginative) allow more freedom and creativity. This matters to reduce the risk of hallucinations.
3. **Enable Tools (Tools)**: Allow the AI to execute actions, such as searching for information on the internet, analyzing data, creating documents, generating images or videos, or interacting with other apps.
4. **Add Knowledge Base**: Feed the AI with your documents and official content to ensure the answers are accurate and aligned with your company.
5. **Use Memory Collections**: Organize and activate sets of information to create your memories and help personalize responses and keep consistency over time.
6. **AI Wallet**: Track your credit balance in real time.
7. **Share conversations**: Send the link or the replay of a chat to other people, making collaboration easier, keeping examples on record, or requesting help.
