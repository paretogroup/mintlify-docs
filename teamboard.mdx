Imagine having a profile page dedicated to showcasing the best creations from your workspace, sharing your knowledge, and building a brand within the Tess AI community. That place exists, and it’s called Teamboard.

This panel is your public showcase, a space where other users can discover, follow, and interact with the agents and content you choose to share.

### **Navigating the Teamboard**

Your panel is made up of a visual identity and engagement metrics, followed by tabs that organize your public content.

<Card icon="1" title="Workspace Identity and Metrics">
  At the top of your panel, users see the essential information that defines your team:

  - Workspace Logo and Name: The visual identity and the name you set in the settings.
  - Title and Cover Image: An impactful phrase and an image that represent your team’s mission.
</Card>

<Card icon="2" title="Engagement Metrics">
  - Runs: The total number of times your workspace’s public agents have been run by the entire Tess community.
  - Followers: How many Tess AI users decided to follow your workspace to keep up with your updates.
  - Following: The number of other workspaces your team follows.
  - Likes: The total number of “likes” your public agents and images received.
</Card>

<Card icon="3" title="Content Tabs">
  Your panel content is organized into three main sections:

  - <u>"AIs"</u> tab:\
    This is your agent gallery. All agents that you or your team created and set as "Workspace" will appear here. It’s the best way to share the agents created with the whole team and with the Tess AI community, if you want to monetize your workspace.
  - <u>"Feed"</u> tab:\
    Works like a visual portfolio. All images generated by members of your workspace and shared publicly are displayed here.
  - <u>"About"</u> tab:\
    This is where you tell your story. This section displays your workspace bio, a description of your mission, and the links to your social networks or website that you added in the settings.
</Card>

### **How to Configure your Panel**

Panel customization is done directly in your workspace settings.
