_Turn any chat conversation into real actions: send emails, create tasks, update spreadsheets, and trigger automation flows — all in natural language._

### **Integrations in the Tess Chat: What Is It?**

Integrations is the new Tess AI feature that <u>turns any chat conversation into a trigger for powerful automations</u>. Now, you can connect Tess AI with thousands of applications through automation platforms such as **Zapier, Make, and N8N**.

  Always remember to activate the tool before using it!

**_Why is this relevant?_**

Even on the best AI platforms in the world, it was not yet possible to **execute activities** across multiple external platforms in an easy way. Existing actions were limited, and users had to switch between multiple tools to get a task fully done.

Instead of just "chatting" with the AI, you actually execute tasks in external tools, without leaving the chat. In other words, <u>Tess becomes the Trigger needed to activate your automation!</u>

  **Automation Platforms**

  Zapier, Make, and N8N are three of the largest automation platforms in the world!

  They allow you to connect more than 10,000 applications and create workflows between them, without code.

  Examples of app categories:

  - CRMs: Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zoho
  - Email: Gmail, Outlook, Microsoft 365
  - Communication: Slack, Teams, Discord, Telegram
  - Management: Notion, Trello, Asana, Monday
  - Financial: Stripe, PayPal, QuickBooks

  And thousands of others.

  However, if the platform you want to work with does not have integration with Zapier, Make, or N8N, you can directly integrate any platform or API that accepts **HTTP requests** through the Tess chat, without any hassle!
