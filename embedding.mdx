  Feature available only on PRO, Team, and Enterprise plans.
</Warning>

Make your Tess agent available directly within websites and applications, as a chat widget or embedded component. Ideal for customer support, lead capture, onboarding, and internal assistants.

### **What is it?**

The Embedding feature allows you to embed a Tess agent into:

- institutional websites
- customer logged-in areas
- your own products / SaaS
- intranets and internal portals

Tess generates an embed code (usually a script or iframe) for you to paste into your website/app. From there, your users can chat with the agent directly within that interface.

### Why it matters

### How to generate an embed code?

  <Step title="Create the agent">
    The first step is creating and testing the agent (prompt, Knowledge Base, Tools, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust the visibility">

  **Best practices**

  - Start by embedding in test/staging environments before going to production.
  - Make sure the agent is configured and tested for external use.
  - Verify that your company's privacy policies cover interactions with AI agents.
