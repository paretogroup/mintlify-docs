    2. Appearance: Choose the visual theme you like most for the platform interface:
       1. Light: The default theme, with a white background.
       2. Dark: A theme with a dark background, ideal for low-light environments and to reduce eye strain.
       3. System: The platform will automatically adopt the theme (light or dark) set in your operating system.
    1. Operations: This setting defines the maximum number of operations (requests) that Tools can execute to generate a single response during a conversation in Tess AI Chat. This is important, for example, for internet research, when you need to search different sources to complete a task.

    <Info>
      Adjusting this value is useful for controlling the complexity and resource consumption of the tools. A higher number (up to 25) allows the AI to perform more elaborate, multi-step tasks to formulate an answer, while a lower number limits the scope of actions.

<Note>
  Important:

  Keep in mind that this limit applies to each individual AI response, not to the conversation as a whole.
