<Card icon="3" title="Add Credits">
  If your plan's credits are running out before the renewal date, you can use this option to make a one-time purchase and top up your wallet. It's the fastest way to ensure continued use of the platform without interruptions.

<Card icon="4" title="Add Seats">

<Card icon="5" title="Cancel My Plan">
  If you want to cancel your subscription and stop using Tess, this button will allow you to schedule the cancellation at the end of the contracted cycle.

  That means if you purchase the monthly plan and use it for 10 days, you'll still have 20 days remaining. If you purchase the annual plan and cancel in the fourth month, you'll still have Tess available for the next 8 months.

<Card icon="6" title="Enable Automatic Top-Up">
  To ensure your team never runs out of credits and has the service interrupted, you can enable automatic top-up (Pay as you Go). This feature monitors your balance and automatically recharges credits when the balance reaches a minimum amount defined by you.

  To set it up, click "Enable automatic top-up" and define the rules:

  - When the credit balance falls below: Set the minimum number of credits that will trigger the top-up.
  - Amount of credits to add: Choose the number of credits (or the corresponding monetary value) that will be purchased with each top-up.

  After adjusting the rules, save the settings to activate the service.
