If you're not satisfied with your purchase, you can request cancellation with a full refund within the <u>7-day guarantee period</u>. This period starts from the day you purchased your first subscription.

### **What you need to know (important)**

<Card icon="1" title="Applicable to first purchase only">
  \
  This refund policy applies only to the first purchase of any plan active at the time of subscription. Subsequent refund requests, on any plan, will be considered fraudulent activity and may result in a ban from the platform.
</Card>

<Card icon="2" title="Immediate plan cancellation">
  \
  At the moment the refund is processed, your plan will be immediately canceled and you will lose access to Tess AI.
</Card>

<Card icon="3" title="Refund processing time">
  \
  Processing may take up to 30 business days, considering the Tess + bank/card issuer flow.
</Card>

<Card icon="4" title="Eligibility">
  \
  You are eligible if:

  - This was your first purchase on any active plan
  - Your request is within the 7-day guarantee period
  - If needed, you can provide proof of purchase or invoice (order number, receipt, etc.)
</Card>

### You can request a refund directly through the platform:

1. Go to your Subscription settings
2. Click "Cancel My Plan"
3. If the request meets the rules above, follow the refund flow within Tess AI and your refund will be automatically approved.

<Warning>
  **Important:**

  If the guarantee period has passed, the subscription will be scheduled for cancellation at the end of the contracted cycle. This means that after the first 7 days:

  - If you purchased the monthly plan, you will have access until the end of the current paid month.
  - If you signed up for the annual plan, the remaining installments (if you paid in installments) are due and your access will remain active until the end.
</Warning>

If you have any difficulty with the process, send an email to [support@tess.im](mailto:support@tess.im).
