title: "Usage Monitoring"
---

Having full visibility into how members of your Workspace use Tess AI can be essential for security, governance, cost control, and process optimization. 

For families, Usage control enables Parental Control, meaning parents who own Workspaces can closely monitor how their children are using AI. On the other hand, managers can track engagement and the progress of their team members.

<Info>
  The "Usage" screen was created for exactly these situations, offering a detailed history of AI interactions in your workspace.
