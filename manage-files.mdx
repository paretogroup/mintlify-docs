title: "Manage Files"

How many times have you asked AI to analyze a text and then had to copy, paste, and adjust everything in the original file? Manage Files was created to eliminate this rework. Instead of just suggesting changes, Tess can edit the file directly and generate a new version ready for download.

### **What Manage Files is**

Manage Files is a tool that allows the AI to:

- read and generate documents
- apply requested changes
- save a new version of the file, preserving formatting and layout as much as possible

It works similarly to Deep Analysis in “execution mode”: you ask in natural language and the AI creates a virtual machine, runs the task (usually via structured document processing), delivering the edited file at the end.

Use it whenever you want Tess to “do it in the file”, not just “tell you how to do it”.

<Note>
  **File format**

  If you want to use a file as a base, remember to use an editable version, meaning: DOCX, PPTX. After all, a PDF can’t be edited, only the existing content can be consumed.
</Note>

Practical examples:

> - "Translate all the text in this presentation to Spanish, keeping the original formatting."
> - "Replace the old logo with the new one on all slides."
> - "Standardize all titles to Arial font, size 24, bold."
> - "Find all occurrences of 'Company A' and replace with 'Company B'."
> - "Add a header with 'Confidential Report – Draft' on all pages."
> - "Create a new column called 'Status' and fill all rows with 'To Process'."

### **Manage Files vs. Deep Analysis (essential difference)**

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card icon="file" title="Manage Files">
    - Objective: analyze shared documents, modify them based on them, or even generate a new file from scratch, only with the prompt command in the chat.
    - Result: a new file made available for download within the chat itself.
  </Card>
  <Card icon="computer-speaker" title="Deep Analysis">
    - Objective: analyze/calculate/understand data with precision (especially spreadsheets/CSVs).
    - Result: an analysis in text, tables, and/or charts (not necessarily a final edited file, but it can also generate a new file).
  </Card>
</Columns>

### **How to use it (step by step)**

1. In chat, click the Tools button (icon next to the message box)
2. Select "Manage Files"
3. Attach the file you want to edit
4. Give the instruction clearly and directly
5. Wait for processing and download the new version of the file

Manage Files is a productivity multiplier and delivers the file ready, drastically reducing manual tasks. Instead of receiving only recommendations, you receive the final edited result ready to use.
