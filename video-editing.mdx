**Why it matters**

With the Video Editing Tools, you can perform professional editing without complex tools. After all, you can:

- Finalize AI-generated or externally recorded videos
- Prepare content for production (chroma key, upscaling)
- Create visual narratives by combining multiple clips
- Add professional audio layers
- Reuse frames to ensure visual continuity

All of this without needing to master traditional editing software like Premiere, After Effects, or DaVinci Resolve.

Choose the desired feature from the tools above, upload the video (or videos) you want to edit, and describe the desired edit (depending on the tool). Wait for processing and download the result!

### **Understanding the Available Tools**

<Card icon="1" title="Runway Aleph">
  Works for advanced editing with retexturing and visual effects. That is, it retextures objects in the video (e.g.: changing the color of a wall, the texture of clothing), computationally alters camera angles, and adds creative visual effects.

  Use it when you need to adjust colors/textures without re-recording, to experiment with alternative camera angles, or to add stylized visual effects.

  Example use: "Change the car color from blue to red, keep the rest of the scene intact." The expected result is the same video with the car retextured in red, without affecting other elements.

<Card icon="2" title="Chroma Key Background">
  Perfect for automatic background removal and replacement with a green screen (chroma key). Makes it easier to apply custom backgrounds later in any editor.

  Use it to prepare videos for compositing in professional editors, when you need to isolate a subject/character from the background, or to create content with virtual backgrounds or dynamic scenarios.

  Recommended workflow:

  - Upload the video with the background you want to remove
  - Automatic processing – the AI removes the background
  - Download the video with the green screen
  - Import into an editor (Premiere, After Effects, etc.) and add a new background
</Card>

<Card icon="3" title="Video Upscale 4x">
  Resolution increase up to 4x with AI. It is the ideal tool for improving video sharpness, reducing distortions and noise, and making it easier to view details lost due to low quality.

  If you have old or low-resolution videos that need a quality upgrade, this tool will help you. Or if you want to improve the quality of AI-generated videos.

  Limitations:

  - Does not create non-existent details – it only enhances what already exists
  - Processing time may vary depending on the video duration
</Card>

<Card icon="4" title="Film Maker">
  Merging clips with professional transitions — that is, it is capable of joining multiple video clips into a single sequence, with smooth transitions between them (or without transitions, when specified).

  Use it to create visual narratives from multiple clips, put together promotional videos, showreels, or storytelling, or to join separately generated scenes into a single fluid video.

  Recommended workflow:

  - Upload the clips in the desired order
  - Choose the transition style (fade, hard cut, dissolve, etc.)
  - Processing – the AI joins the clips with natural transitions

  Transition types:

  - Fade: Gradual darkening effect, ideal for dramatic scene changes
  - Dissolve: Gradual overlap effect, used for time passages
  - Cut: Direct cut effect, used for fast-paced rhythm and action
  - Slide: Lateral sliding effect, for spatial connection between scenes
</Card>

<Card icon="5" title="Sound to Video">
  Audio generation and combination tool for video. It can generate audio from text prompts or visual video content, combine multiple audio tracks into a single video, and overlay sound layers (music, narration, effects, ambience).

  Use it to add a soundtrack to silent videos, create custom soundscapes, overlay narration, background music and sound effects, etc.
</Card>

<Card icon="6" title="Extract Last Frame">
  This tool is perfect for capturing the last frame as a static image (JPEG/PNG).

  Its use is recommended for creating continuity between AI-generated videos using the extracted static image. In this case, use the last frame of Video A as the first frame of Video B for naturally perfect and fluid transitions, or use it to create custom thumbnails, etc.
</Card>

<Card icon="7" title="Wan Animate">
  The Wan 2.2 Animate models allow you to replace characters in reference videos while maintaining the original movement, or transfer movement from one video to a new scene with a different character and background.

  Operation modes:

  1. Animate Replace Mode (Character Replacement)

  - Input: Original video + image of the new character
  - Output: Video with the new character performing the same movements
  - Preserves: Movement, original setting

  2. Animate Animation Mode (Copy Movement)

  - Input: Reference video (movement) + character image + new scene
  - Output: New video with an animated character performing the movement from the original video
  - Preserves: Movement
  - Replaces: Character and background
</Card>

  **Tips**

  - Use videos with good lighting and adequate resolution
  - Avoid heavily compressed videos or those with excessive noise
  - Start with short clips before processing longer videos
  - Upscale 4x → Chroma Key → Film Maker → Sound to Video
  - Create complete post-production pipelines within Tess
