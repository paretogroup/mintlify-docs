The Tess AI Conversation History is the place where all your interactions with the AI are saved automatically.

### **Where is the history?**

On the left side of the main screen, you'll find the list of your chats organized chronologically. Each new chat is saved automatically and receives a name generated by Tess itself, based on the beginning of the conversation (which can be renamed).

From there, you can:

1. <u>Reopen previous conversations:</u> click on any conversation in the list to open the full history. You can continue the conversation exactly where you left off, reusing all the context already built.
2. <u>Organize into folders:</u> to keep everything organized, you can create folders and group conversations, for example, by topic (e.g., "Marketing", "Legal", "Internal Support"), by project (e.g., "Q3 Launch", "Client Onboarding"), by client, etc.

   />
3. <u>Rename or delete chats:</u> If a name assigned isn't ideal, or you're following a specific naming pattern, you can rename it. Or, if a chat has no relevance and you want to delete it, you can do so. Keep in mind that this action is not reversible.

4. <u>Reuse content:</u> By revisiting conversations, you can copy important excerpts already produced, turn old responses into documents, or use previous conversations as a basis for new prompts.
