title: "Team Board"

Imagine having a dedicated profile page to showcase your workspace's best creations, share your knowledge, and build a brand within the Tess AI community. That place exists and it's called the Team Board.

This board is your public showcase, a space where other users can discover, follow, and interact with the agents and content you choose to share.

### **Navigating the Team Board**

Your board is made up of a visual identity and engagement metrics, followed by tabs that organize your public content.

<Card icon="1" title="Workspace Identity and Metrics">
  At the top of your board, users see the essential information that defines your team:

  - Workspace Logo and Name: The visual identity and name you set in the settings.
  - Title and Cover Image: An impactful phrase and an image that represent your team's mission.
</Card>

<Card icon="2" title="Engagement Metrics">
  - Executions: The total number of times your workspace's public agents have been executed by the entire Tess community.
  - Followers: How many Tess AI users have decided to follow your workspace to keep up with your updates.
  - Following: The number of other workspaces your team follows.
  - Likes: The total number of "likes" your public agents and images have received.
</Card>

<Card icon="3" title="Content Tabs">
  Your board's content is organized into three main sections:

  - <u>"AIs"</u> Tab:\
    This is your agent gallery. All agents that you or your team have created and set as "Workspace" will appear here. It's the best way to share the agents you've created with the entire team and with the Tess AI community, in case you want to monetize your workspace.
  - <u>"Feed"</u> Tab:\
    Works like a visual portfolio. All images generated by members of your workspace that have been publicly shared are displayed here.
  - <u>"About"</u> Tab:\
    This is where you tell your story. This section displays your workspace's biography, a description of your mission, and the links to your social media or website that you added in the settings.
</Card>
