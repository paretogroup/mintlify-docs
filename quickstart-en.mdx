Chat Mode is the simplest way to interact with Tess. We offer a unified interface where you can collaboratively use text, image, video, audio, narration, avatar creation models, as well as a variety of professional tools.

Tess orchestrates all of this work for you, turning the use of multiple types of AI into an integrated, conversational, and frictionless experience.

## Starting a Conversation

To get started, simply type your command (prompt) in the text box. You can ask questions, ask the AI to perform tasks, request text creation, analyze data, and much more.

- **Clear Commands and Instructions**: The clearer and more detailed your request, the better the result. Instead of saying "create a text", try being more specific: "create a text for a LinkedIn post about the impact of artificial intelligence on the financial market, with a professional tone and a call-to-action for a webinar".
- **Tess Micro Playbooks**: Just below the chat box, you have several "ice breaker" options to help you think of use cases and generate the corresponding prompts. All of these themes are available to help you get started with quality — Presentations, Search and Files, Web Development, Videos, Voice and Music, Images, Create Agents.

## Choosing the AI Model

Tess AI offers the flexibility to choose the most suitable AI model for each task.

You can manually select a specific model (such as Claude 4.5 Opus or ChatGPT 5.2) at the bottom of the chat window, or work with Auto Mode.

In Auto Mode, Tess analyzes your request and automatically selects the model with the best balance between cost and performance for that specific task, optimizing the use of your credits.

## Activating Your Agents in Chat Mode

You can call a specific agent to respond in the conversation at any time by using "@" followed by the agent's name. For example: @MarketingAgent, create three slogan options for my new campaign. This option is not available for private agents.

## Adding a Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base allows you to upload files (such as PDFs, DOCX, TXT, etc.) so that the chosen model can consult that information before responding. It means training the chat with greater accuracy.

Imagine asking the AI to create a summary of a report or to answer specific questions about your own product manual. Simply attach the file to the chat and make your request to ensure accurate and relevant answers.

  When you add a knowledge base in the chat, only that conversation is trained. If you need to use that knowledge base regularly, create an agent and train it with the documentation. In that case, the agent will always activate the added knowledge base.

## Activating a Tool

Tools enhance the performance of models or agents. They are features that enable actions beyond text generation, such as accessing the internet or social media to search for up-to-date information, creating virtual machines for data analysis and financial calculations, or generating/editing files.

Next to the chat box, you will find a menu of available Tools. Before sending your request, you can activate the "Internet" tool, for example. That way, when you ask "What were the main technology news stories this week?", the AI will use the internet to formulate the most up-to-date response.
