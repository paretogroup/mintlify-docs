### **Step-by-Step: Triggering a Tess AI Agent from n8n**

Want to connect n8n with Tess AI? Here's a quick and friendly guide to get you started!

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Workflow">
    Open n8n and start a new workflow. Each step (node) represents an action or service.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add an HTTP Request Node">
    Search for "HTTP Request" in the node panel and add it to your workflow. This node will send a message to your Tess AI agent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the HTTP Request">
    - **URL:** Use `https://api.tess.ai/agents/{agent_id}/execute` (replace `{agent_id}` with your agent's ID, found in the Tess AI platform URL).
    - **Method:** Set to `POST`.
    - **Headers:** Add `Authorization: Bearer {your_token}` (generate your API token in Tess AI under "API Tokens").
    - **Body:** Set to `JSON` and include the message you want to send, e.g.:

      ```json
         {
         "temperature": "1",
         "model": "tess-5",
         "messages": [
             { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, how can you help me today?" }
         ],
         "tools": "no-tools",
         "wait_execution": true,
         "file_ids": [123, 321]
         }
      
      ```

      (You can use n8n expressions to insert dynamic values from previous nodes, like WhatsApp messages.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for the Agent's Response">
    Make sure to include the parameter "wait_execution": true in your request body. This tells Tess AI to wait for the agent's response before moving on, so you can use the reply in the next steps.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Your Flow">
    Save and run your workflow. Check the output of the HTTP node to see the agent's response. If something's off, double-check your token, agent ID, and JSON formatting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send the Response Back">
    Want to reply to a user (e.g., on WhatsApp)? Add another node after the HTTP Request to send the agent's answer back.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Tips:**

  - Keep your API token safe—never share it publicly!
  - You can remove advanced parameters from the request if they're already set up in your agent.
  - Always validate user input before sending it to the agent.
