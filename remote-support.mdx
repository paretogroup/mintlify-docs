We understand that, at times, questions or specific situations may arise that require a more in-depth analysis. Remote Support was created for those moments. It is a feature that allows our team to access your account securely and temporarily.

When you request it, you grant a temporary permission—valid for 72 hours—so that one of our specialists can access your account. This allows us to view your settings, interactions, and the exact context of the issue, without you needing to share passwords or credentials. It is a safe, practical, and efficient method for us to provide the help you need.

### **1. When should you request Remote Support?**

- Unexpected behavior: When an agent or feature does not behave as expected.
- Configuration difficulties: If you need help setting up a more complex feature.
- Issue analysis: So our team can thoroughly investigate an error or difficulty that was not resolved with general guidance.
