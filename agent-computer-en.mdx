Tess Agent Computer is an autonomous General AI Agent that moves beyond standard AI conversations. Rather than handling prompts individually, Tess Agent Computer takes on complex, multi-step work and carries it through from start to finish on your behalf.

Tell Tess what you need, walk away, and return to completed work — polished documents, organized files, consolidated research, spreadsheets with fully working formulas, dashboards and more.

The Agent Computer can be accessed directly within the Tess chat interface by switching the applicable function from Chat Mode to Agent Mode.

## What is Tess Agent Computer?

Tess Agent Computer changes the way you work with AI. While standard conversations require your presence at every stage, Tess Agent works on its own — planning, executing, and delivering results without you having to monitor each action.

This level of autonomous execution is not available in regular conversations outside of Tess.

## Key capabilities

## How Tess Agent runs your tasks

Code runs securely inside an isolated environment, but Tess is capable of making real changes to your files and systems.

Once you kick off a task in Agent Computer, Tess:

Reviews your request and builds an execution plan.

1. Breaks the work into subtasks whenever needed, keeping things efficient.
2. Runs everything inside a secure, isolated virtual machine (VM).
3. Manages multiple workstreams simultaneously, where it makes sense to do so.
4. Delivers the final outputs straight to your file system.

You stay fully informed of what Tess is planning and doing at every stage. You can step in to provide guidance whenever it matters — or simply let Tess handle everything independently.

  At certain points, Tess Agent may check in with a few questions to make sure the final output is exactly what you had in mind.
