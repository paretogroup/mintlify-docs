title: "Tess Autopilot"

It’s very common that every professional in their day-to-day needs to deal with complex work that even AI takes a bit longer to deliver: extensive research, analyzing a large document, generating a complete report.

Tess Autopilot was created to make this kind of task easier, without you having to keep following the AI’s work, or even keep your computer on or the tab open. Now you can request the work, give the instructions, and simply let Tess work and finish the job for you. During that time, you can have a coffee, sleep, or dedicate yourself to other work.

Tess Autopilot keeps the AI running in the background, with high resilience to connection drops and app closures, so you no longer need to “watch over” task execution.

### **What Tess Autopilot is**

Tess Autopilot is the new operation mode for the Tess AI chat that ensures:

  <Card href="/quickstart-pt" title="Execução em segundo plano">
    The chat keeps working on your task even when you close the app/page.
  </Card>
  <Card href="/agent-computer" title="Resistência extrema">
    Up to 50 minutes of uninterrupted work on a single task.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

  <Card href="/usando-o-chat" title="Ferramentas aprimoradas">
    Use of Tools working stably for up to 40 minutes.
  </Card>
  <Card href="/tipos-de-agentes" title="Conexão inquebrável">
    Automatic reconnection in case of fluctuation or a 4G/Wi‑Fi drop.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

In other words, Autopilot turns the experience of “waiting for the AI to respond” into something much more robust, closer to a cloud processing service: you ask, go on with your life, and come back only to receive the result. It’s your agents working autonomously even while you rest.

### **Main pillars of Tess Autopilot**

Tess Autopilot is the new operation mode for the Tess AI chat that ensures:

  <Card href="/quickstart-pt" title="Execução em segundo plano">
    “Background execution” means the AI no longer depends on your window or app staying open all the time.

    Tess Autopilot was designed to support long tasks. Today, it allows up to 50 minutes of uninterrupted work in a single chat flow.

    With Autopilot, Tools start working reliably for up to 40 minutes same execution.

<Info>
  Beyond the text itself, Tess Autopilot also improves stability when using Tools (chat tools), such as Internet, Deep Analysis, Manage Files, Music, Speech, Avatar, Video, etc.

With Autopilot, Tools start working reliably for up to 40 minutes in the same execution. This is especially important for:

Network problems shouldn’t interrupt your workflow. With Tess Autopilot, if the 4G or Wi‑Fi signal fluctuates or drops, the system tries to reconnect automatically.

Of course, as long as the task is still within the execution window (up to 50 minutes of chat and 40 of Tools), processing continues on the server. When the connection is restored, you see the result or the progress directly in the chat, without needing to start over.

This is especially valuable for those who work while on the move (coworking, café, airport); in places with unstable Wi‑Fi or using 4G/5G as the main connection.

### **Perfect use cases for Tess Autopilot**

<Card icon="1" title="Pesquisas e relatórios extensos">
  “Do detailed research on AI trends in the financial sector, bringing references, examples of companies, and regulatory risks.”

  “Build a comparative report among the main competitors X, Y, and Z, with a table of pros and cons.”
</Card>

<Card icon="2" title="Análise de documentos e dados pesados:">
  Long contracts, dossiers, technical reports, and extensive articles.

  Large spreadsheets with many records (sales, churn, NPS, etc.).

  Here, Autopilot ensures that:

  • the chat and Deep Analysis have time to read, process, and calculate everything;

  • you don’t lose the execution if you need to close the app or if the internet fluctuates.

  Here, Autopilot ensures that:

  • the chat and Deep Analysis have time to read, process, and calculate everything;

  • you don’t lose the execution if you need to close the app or if the internet fluctuates.
</Card>

<Card icon="4" title="Fluxos multimídia mais robustos">
  Generating videos, audios, avatars, music tracks, and combinations among these tools.

  • Tasks that chain multiple Tools and require more processing time.

  With Autopilot, these chains have a much higher chance of reaching the end without interruptions.

Tess Autopilot is the natural evolution for those who use AI as a serious part of their work: AI stops being something you need to “monitor” and becomes a true 24/7 assistant, that keeps working with you — and for you — even when the connection fluctuates, the app closes, or your focus needs to go somewhere else.
