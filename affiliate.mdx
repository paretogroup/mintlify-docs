### **Practical Example of Earning Potential**

Imagine you referred Tess AI to a company, and they purchased a plan with 10 licenses (seats) at a cost of \$40 per license/month.

> _Annual contract value: 10 seats x \$40 x 12 months = \$4,800_
>
> _Your commission (10%): \$480_
>
> With a single referral, you would earn \$480.

**Troubleshooting: Payment with "Returned" status**

Occasionally, a commission payment may not be completed and may appear with the status **"Returned."**

This means the payment was correctly processed by our payments partner (Cello), but it was returned by PayPal due to an issue with the affiliate’s own account.

The most common reasons for this to happen are:

- The PayPal account email registered on the affiliate platform is incorrect or doesn’t exist.
- The PayPal account hasn’t been fully verified.
- There is a restriction or block on the PayPal account that prevents receiving funds.

> **How to fix it**
>
> - Review your details: Make sure the PayPal email registered in the affiliate dashboard is correct.
> - Check your PayPal account: Log in to your PayPal account and confirm there are no pending verification steps or account restrictions. If you have questions, contact PayPal support.
> - Update the information: After fixing any pending issue, update or re-enter your payment email in the affiliate dashboard. A new payment attempt will be made automatically in the next cycle.
