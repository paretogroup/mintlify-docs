  **Limitations:**

  It’s important to keep in mind that training your AI based on PDF documents extracted through Tess AI has a size limitation. 

  Training cannot exceed 80,000 words. Therefore, make sure the selected PDF is within this limit. If you have a PDF with more than 80,000 words, consider splitting it into smaller parts or selecting only the most relevant sections.
