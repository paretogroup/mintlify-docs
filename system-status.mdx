Tess AI provides a dedicated page where you can monitor in real time the operational status of all our services.

### **What is the System Status page?**

The "System Status" page is a centralized dashboard that reports on the operability of the Tess AI platform and the integrated APIs. If any instability or scheduled maintenance occurs, it will be the first place to reflect that information.
