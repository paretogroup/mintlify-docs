## Why Use Tess AI?

Unlike traditional chat tools that simply answer questions, Tess orchestrates collaboration between 250+ specialized AI models to generate superior quality outputs - taking action and delivering actual results.

Think of Tess as a team of AI experts, each a specialist in their field—text, image, video, code, audio, etc.—working together in a coordinated way to complete tasks from start to finish, with up to 8x better performance than single-model platforms.

Traditional AI tools require constant supervision and manual intervention — you guide them step by step, then manually piece together the results yourself. Tess AI works differently. It independently plans, executes, and sees tasks through to completion, delivering exactly what you need: a custom tool, a slide presentation, a market research report, or virtually anything else you have in mind.

## Intelligent Model Orchestration

We believe that **no single AI is better than all of them working together.** Tess is not just a model aggregator—we are the orchestration layer that allows hundreds of specialized AIs to collaborate intelligently through a single interface and with a unique agentic approach.

When you request a task, Tess:

- Analyzes which model is best suited for each step
- Orchestrates collaboration between multiple specialized models
- Integrates the results into a cohesive and professional final output
- Result: Up to 8x higher performance in creative quality, task accuracy, and business insight generation.

## Unlimited Collaboration

We are the first AI platform with a shared wallet system. Instead of charging per user, we allow unlimited users per workspace — ideal for families, teams, and businesses.

## Total Transparency

Tess AI adopts a unique market positioning: we are committed to being the most transparent AI platform in the world – no hidden caps, no "fair use" clauses. With Tess AI, you:

- Know exactly how many credits you have purchased and can monitor your balance in real time in your AI Wallet.
- Are informed – before and after – of the concrete or estimated cost for executing each task.
- Have transparent pricing: our models are offered at the cost of the API + a 20% margin.

No surprises: no hidden limitations or unexpected account suspensions.
