The Podcast tool in Tess AI Chat will be your automated podcasting studio. It turns a script into a complete audio episode, with multiple voices, dialogues, and long duration — no microphone, no manual editing, and no audio software.

<Info>
  This is a tool powered by advanced audio technology models. It reads your script and:

  - interprets who the characters are
  - assigns different voices
  - generates a single cohesive audio file, simulating a podcast show with multiple participants
  - It goes far beyond simple voiceover: it creates the feeling of a conversation, interview, debate, or roundtable.
</Info>

### **Key advantages**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Long-form episodes">
    You’re not limited to a few seconds. It’s possible to create substantial episodes (like 10 minutes or more) in a single run.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multiple voices and characters">
    In practice, there isn’t a strict limit on characters. You can create a host + co-host, interviewer + interviewee, a panel with multiple experts. All in a single script.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multi-language">
    The Podcast Generator supports multiple languages, allowing you to produce episodes for different audiences or even mix segments in different languages (for example, questions in Portuguese and answers in English).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### **How to use it and create your podcast**

The flow is simple: just enable the tool and start making requests, choose the voice, send the script, and generate the episode.

All the complex work of editing, mixing, and assembling voices is handled by the AI. In the end, you receive a ready-to-download audio file that you can publish on podcast platforms, social media, or your website.

<Tip>
  **Tips:**

  1. **Clearly identify who is speaking**

  Use a script format—this helps the AI separate lines, alternate voices, and keep a conversational rhythm:

  [Host]: Welcome to another episode of our podcast!

  [AI Specialist]: Thanks for the invitation, it’s a pleasure to be here.

  2. **Mark emotions and intonation**

  Give simple acting directions:

  [Host, in an excited tone]: Today’s news is simply incredible!

  [Interviewee, in a low and reflective voice]: I had never thought of it that way… [pause]
