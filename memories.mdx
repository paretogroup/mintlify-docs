title: "Memories"
---

Your memories are structured records (information, texts, parts of responses) that you save, organize into collections, and Tess can consult at any time during your work on the platform.

You can decide, at any moment, which memory collections you want to keep active/inactive for each task. It is fully modular.

In the Chat, you connect the conversation to Memory Collections, which store, for example:

- profile data (company, segment, plan)
- user or account preferences
- relevant history for future interactions
- important notes about specific projects and cases

These memories can be used in new conversations, without the user needing to repeat everything every time. You can activate or deactivate any Memory Collection at any time.

## Why is it important?

- Real personalization: Tess responds taking into account the history (the memory), not just the current message.
- Less repetition: The user does not need to provide the same information at every interaction.
- Context for the team: Organized memories help both the AI and the human team maintain the same level of service, even when agents change.
- Work organization: you can organize your memories by team, by project, by client, or however you prefer, bringing versatility to the way you work with AI.

## Setting Up and Managing Memories

- Open the Chat screen
- Locate the Memory Collections icon (atom) in the upper right corner
- Select an existing collection or create a new one, according to your needs
- Create memories and a collection
- Remember to activate the collection — a number will appear on the atom symbol and active collections will be highlighted in color

<Info>
  In the Memories icon, you can:

  - Activate or deactivate memory collections
  - Create new collections segmented by use case
  - Review, edit, or remove existing memories
</Info>

After activating a collection, you can start the conversation normally in the chat. Observe whether the LLM is using the memory information to complement the responses (when it makes sense).

## Best Practices

- Clearly define what type of information can become a memory — and what should never be saved (for example, sensitive data, passwords, information that violates privacy or compliance policies).
- Use different collections for different contexts (one for support, another for sales, another for internal projects).
- Periodically review memories and collections to remove what is outdated or irrelevant, keeping only what truly helps with personalization and service quality.
