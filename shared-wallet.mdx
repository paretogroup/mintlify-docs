title: "Shared Wallet"
---

At Tess AI, we believe artificial intelligence should be a collaborative tool. That’s why we created a model that lets you use a single subscription to work with as many people as you want in the same workspace, sharing credits in one shared wallet.

### What is the Shared Wallet?

The Shared Wallet is the feature that lets you invite coworkers, friends, or even family members to your workspace at no extra cost per user. Instead of paying per “seat,” your billing is based on the AI credits the team actually consumes.

Tess AI works as an AI Marketplace: you have a fixed-price subscription (annual or monthly) and pay only for credit usage, without worrying about the number of members. It’s a pool of credits that can be shared among countless workspace members.

### How to Invite New Members to Your Workspace

Adding people to your work environment is a simple process.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    Log in to your Tess AI account, click your user menu (bottom-left corner), and go to "Settings".

      title="Tessdocs Settingbottom"
      style={{ width:"34%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the Members Area">
    In settings, click the "Members" tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a New Member">
    Click the "Add new member" button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send the Invitation">
    Enter the email address of the person you want to invite and send the invitation.

    _The invited person will receive an email with an access link. After accepting and creating their account, they will become part of your workspace, using the same credit wallet as you._
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Understanding Billing and Credit Usage

All credits in your plan, whether from the subscription or from one-off packages, go into a single Wallet, which is shared by all workspace members.

With each content generation or interaction with AI, a small amount of credits is debited from the wallet, depending on the AI model used.

<Note>
  **Important Note About Legacy Plans**

  For users on legacy plans (older subscription models, such as Beginner, Individual, and Business), seat-based billing may still apply. If you have one of these plans, check the specific conditions of your subscription or contact our support to migrate to one of the new plans. In any case, even in these situations, we have resources to invite additional users at no cost.
</Note>

**Best Practices for Account Management**

> 1. Align expectations: Agree with the members of your workspace on how credits will be used (for work, studying, testing, etc.).
> 2. Track usage: If you are the account administrator, access the "Wallet" area periodically to understand the usage pace and ensure credits are sufficient for the team’s needs.
> 3. Learn together: Use the Shared Wallet to encourage the people around you to learn about artificial intelligence with you.

At Tess AI, we start from the idea that AI should be collaborative. With the Shared Wallet, you can bring those around you into the same account, learn together, and take advantage of the platform’s full potential without barriers.
