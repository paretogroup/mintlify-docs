The Tess AI Rewards Program lets you earn credits by completing simple actions (like following our profiles) and high-impact actions (like reviews on platforms and a video testimonial). These credits go into your wallet and can be used normally in Tess.

<Note>
  **Important:**

  _Rewards verification is done manually by our team. To validate correctly, the emails used on the platforms (e.g., G2 and Gartner) must be the same as the one used on your Tess account._
</Note>

### **Where to find it (how to access it)?**

Click the user icon in the lower-left corner of Tess and then click Rewards:

You can complete the actions in any order and only complete the ones that make sense for you. Make sure the email is the same before posting reviews on G2 or Gartner—this is the fastest and safest way for the team to validate your reward.

Complete the action and keep clicking the checkmark in Tess AI. Wait for approval. After the manual review, the credits are added to your wallet.

    - Signs of abuse/fraud (may lead to loss of the reward and account measures)

    - link to your profile/review (when a public link exists)
    - screenshot showing the action completed 
    - for video: file link or the format indicated on the page itself
