title: "Visibility"

Visibility defines the privacy level of the agent created in Agent Studio. You can choose between the following levels:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Workspace">
    Available only to members of your workspace. This is the ideal mode to keep control of internal agents.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Private">
    Visible only to you (and, if applicable, authorized workspace administrators).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Public">
    Available for use by the entire Tess user community and is listed in the Marketplace.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unlisted">
    It doesn’t appear in the Marketplace, but anyone in Tess who receives the link can access it.
  </Card>
</Columns>

### **Why is it important?**

- Security and confidentiality: agents with sensitive data should be private or limited to the workspace.
- Controlled sharing: experimental agents can be unlisted, accessible only via link.
- Distribution and community: mature agents can be made public and shared with the entire Tess user base.

### Understanding Visibility Levels in detail

<Card icon="1" title="Workspace">
  All workspace members can access the agent. It’s great for agents created by company members so other colleagues can use them.
</Card>

<Card icon="2" title="Private">
  Only the agent creator can see it. Used for draft agents, tests, or personal agents.
</Card>

<Card icon="3" title="Public">
  In this case, any Tess user can find and use the agent, and it becomes available and listed in the Marketplace. Used for agents ready to be reused by others (more generic and broad), market templates, showcases, etc.
</Card>

<Card icon="4" title="Unlisted">
  It can’t be found in the Marketplace, and only people with the direct link can open it. It’s used when you want to share with specific clients, partners, or in beta phases for testing by other people.

### **How to adjust an agent’s visibility**

When creating the Agent, you can set visibility inside Agent Studio by selecting your preferred option. The agent will be created with that setting.

In addition, you can always adjust the visibility level in Agent Studio:

1. Open Agent Studio
2. Find the agent you want to configure. You can use the search field, type, visibility, or Owner.
3. Check the Visibility column and choose the desired level

  **IMPORTANT**\

  If you choose to make your agent public, review its name, description, and content before exposing it in the Marketplace. Our team will review and test your agent before making it definitively public. If it’s rejected, they will point out the reasons for adjustment and a new review.

<Tip>
  **Best practices**

  - Start with the agent as Private during the testing phase.
  - When it’s mature, switch to Workspace so the whole team can use it.
  - Only make Public what you truly want to share with the community, without sensitive data.
  - Use Unlisted for pilots with selected clients, without exposing it in the Marketplace.
