With Tess AI’s Audio Generator, you can convert any text into a smooth, natural voiceover using a wide range of voices and languages.

### **What is the Audio Generator?**

The Audio Generator is an Artificial Intelligence tool that synthesizes a human voice from written text. Integrated into Agent Studio, it allows you to generate high-quality audio files without the need for microphones, recording studios, or professional voice talent.

With an intuitive interface, you can choose between different voice profiles, adjust the tone, speed, and narration style so it fits perfectly with the message you want to deliver.

### **Tips for a High-Quality Voiceover**

To ensure the result sounds natural and professional, consider the following tips:

- Review the Text: Typos or grammar errors can be interpreted literally by the AI. Always review the text before generating the audio.
- Use Punctuation: Commas, periods, and other punctuation marks help the AI create the correct pauses and intonation, making the narration more human.
- Test Different Voices: Each voice has a unique style. Try different profiles to find the one that best aligns with your brand and your audience.
