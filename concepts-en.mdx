  <Accordion title="AI Agents">
    Think of AI Agents as your specialized virtual assistants. Each agent is an AI trained to perform specific tasks, such as analyzing documents, generating reports, creating creative content, or managing your interactions with customers. You can create an agent with a simple prompt so that it systematically performs any task.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent Computer">
    Tess Agent Computer is an autonomous general AI agent built to complete tasks and deliver results end to end. With a single prompt, you can run entire workflows — from market analysis and spreadsheet creation to building websites, dashboards, and much more. Far beyond a simple chatbot, Tess Agent actively plans, executes, and delivers the complete output with exceptional quality.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AI Models">
    An AI model is a type of system designed to create new content — text, images, videos, audio, and more — based on parameters that were provided to it during its training. Examples of models include ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude Sonnet, etc. Unlike traditional AI models, which only recognize patterns or classify information, generative models can produce something new and original, simulating human creativity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent Studio">
    Agent Studio is your agent creation environment in Tess AI. This is the area of the platform where you can build, customize, and manage your own AI Agents. In Agent Studio, you build prompts, define models, the level of privacy, the knowledge base, and the tools your agents will use.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tools">
    Tools are resources that you can add to your AI Agents or to the Tess chat itself to further enhance performance. They allow agents to perform specific actions, such as searching for information on the internet and on social media, creating images and documents, analyzing data in spreadsheets, and much more.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Knowledge Base">
    The Knowledge Base is the information repository that you provide to your AI Agents or add directly in the chat to improve their training and make them more accurate. You can upload documents, spreadsheets, images, add website URLs, and other materials so that your agents or your conversations can learn about a specific topic. A well-structured knowledge base maximizes the accuracy and reliability of the answers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Memories">
    Memories allow AI Agents to learn from past interactions. They work as a record of relevant and reusable snippets from previous conversations, which can be saved and organized into collections, ensuring that the AI remembers the context and your preferences over time. This feature makes future interactions more personalized and efficient. You can decide at any time which memories will be active or inactive for each conversation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Prompt">
    The Prompt is the instruction you give to an AI Agent or to the model used directly in the chat. It is how you "ask" or "request" that it perform a task. The clarity and quality of your prompt are essential to obtain the best results. A good prompt is specific, contextualized, and clear about the expected outcome.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AI Wallet">
    Your Credit Wallet is the control center for your usage in Tess AI. Each plan has a certain amount of credits that is deposited into your AI Wallet for you to use as you wish within the platform.

    Each action performed on the platform consumes credits, and the amount of credits may vary depending on the complexity of the task and the AI model used. More advanced models and features such as Max Mode, for example, consume more credits.

    You can check your balance and usage history at any time directly on the platform, ensuring full transparency and control over your investment. Managing the AI Wallet is the responsibility of the user.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Marketplace">
    Tess AI's Marketplace is the largest collaborative AI space on the planet, where users can discover, buy, and sell AI Agents through the monetization features mentioned above.

    The Marketplace works as a large showcase of ready-made solutions for the most diverse challenges and industries, creating a win-win situation for users: on one hand, creators can leverage their skills and earn money; on the other hand, new users have the opportunity to find useful agents for their work and start using them right away, increasing the value they capture on the platform.
