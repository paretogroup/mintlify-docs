title: "Video Generation"

The Video Tools let you turn a prompt (text description) into video clips. Within the “Tools” menu in the chat, you can choose between different video generation models, each with its own style and behavior, to reach the ideal result for your project more quickly.

### **Where to find the Video Tools**

1. Open the chat
2. Click the Tools button (last icon at the bottom left of the message box)
3. Look for the tools section/list and select a Video tool

Within the video Tools, you’ll see options for several video generation models, such as:

1. Tess 6
2. Kling
3. Runway
4. Sora
5. VEO
6. Wan
7. Seedance
8. Hailou

After selecting one of the AIs, write your prompt and ask it to generate the video.

### **Why are there several video tools/models?**

Because each model interprets prompts in a different way and tends to stand out in specific styles. In practice, having several models gives you more aesthetic options (realistic, animated, cinematic, etc.), more chances to nail your project’s look with less trial and error, and greater flexibility to test the same prompt in different models and choose the best result.

### **How to use the Video Tools**

In the Video Tools menu, choose one of the models from the list. Then write a prompt thinking in terms of “movement”, since video is not just appearance; it’s action, camera, and duration.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card icon="sparkles" title="Include the Elements">
    - Subject: what appears
    - Action: what happens
    - Environment: where it happens
    - Camera movement: static, travelling, close-up, slow motion...
    - Style: cinematic, realistic, animation, etc.
    - Aspect ratio (if needed): 9:16, 16:9, 1:1
  </Card>
  <Card icon="check-double" title="Prompt Examples">
    - “Aerial travelling shot over a dense, foggy forest at dawn; sunrays cut through the mist and reveal a winding river.”
    - “Close-up of hands typing on a mechanical keyboard, blue and purple neon light, shallow depth of field, stable camera.”
  </Card>
</Columns>

Generate the clip and check whether the action is clear, whether the style matches your expectations, and whether there is visual consistency (objects “changing” too much). Video generation is highly iterative; with each improvement and refinement, you’ll move toward better practice and achieve increasingly satisfying results. Test 2 or 3 models with the same prompt when aesthetics are important.

<Info>
  The same prompt can generate very different results depending on the model. A simple exercise is to write a very detailed prompt, generate it in two different models, and compare: realism, camera movement, consistency (objects/face/hands), “mood”, and lighting.
</Info>

The models that generate videos with sound (speech or sound effects) are only: Wan, Veo, and Sora. They can therefore consume more credits, but if you need this feature, the ideal is to work with one of them. If what you need is a simpler motion or animation, the other models will not only be less costly but will also be able to meet your needs well.
