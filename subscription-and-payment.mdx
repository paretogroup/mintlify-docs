1. **PLANS AND PAYMENTS**

The main questions about our plans.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are Tess AI’s plans?">
    Currently, we offer the Basic, Pro, Team, and Enterprise plans. Each plan provides a set of features and a credit volume suited to different usage profiles.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do credits and usage work?">
    At Tess AI, transparency is essential. Unlike other platforms, you’ll always know exactly how many credits you have and how much each AI model consumes. Tess operates as a marketplace: we simply pass along the cost of each model (set by its respective provider), with a flat margin.

    For every action performed on the platform (and each selected model), credit consumption (or its proxy) is clearly displayed. In chat, you’ll see the number of credits consumed per 100 input tokens (what you send to the AI) and per 100 output tokens (the AI’s response). For image and video, you’ll be informed, for example, of the cost to generate each artifact. This allows you to manage your credits diligently, choosing the most suitable model for each task. 

    • <u>Diligent Management:</u> Just like you manage your personal finances, it’s important to manage your credits on the platform. AI models for image and video, for example, tend to consume more credits than text models. By selecting the right model for the task, you optimize your usage and ensure your credits last longer. 

    All users can track their credit balance in real time in the AI Wallet by clicking the yellow coin icon in the top-right corner of the chat.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is billing per user?">
    No. In all plans, we charge by usage. We use a shared wallet system, allowing unlimited members to be added to the Workspace. Billing is therefore usage-based, managed through Tess’s credit system!

    In other words, you can invite unlimited users at no extra cost: family, coworkers, college classmates, etc. Each person gets their own private account with individual usage tracking, but everyone uses a shared pool of Workspace credits. 

    This is the ideal model for teams or study groups to collaborate on projects, as well as for family use (“family account”), noting that Tess offers the Parental Control feature so parents can monitor AI usage by young people. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I add or remove members from my account at any time?">
    Yes. You can add or remove members from your workspace at any time within the Members area. 

    On the Enterprise plan, you also get Single Sign-On (SSO), which provides more security for all employees.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What payment methods are available?">
    Payment is made by credit card, with the option to split the annual amount into up to 12 interest-free installments. And, on annual plans, we offer the option to pay via PIX.

    On the Enterprise plan, the company can also choose other payment options, such as boleto, PIX, and bank transfer.

2. **MANAGING YOUR SUBSCRIPTION**

Keeping control of your subscription is simple and intuitive in Tess AI.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I upgrade my plan?">
    You can upgrade your plan at any time. Just go to your account settings and click "Manage Plan". There, you can choose the plan that best fits your needs, and the upgrade will be applied immediately for all members of your account. In this case, billing will be pro rata, calculated proportionally considering the end of the current cycle, whether monthly or annual.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I access usage data?">
    As the owner of your company’s workspace, you have full visibility into credit consumption and platform usage. You can export the data to analyze individually who is consuming more or less, as well as monitor Tess’s execution history, including conversations, image generations, or video generations. To do so, go to settings and then to the Usage tab.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

3. **SUBSCRIPTION CANCELLATION**

We understand needs can change. That’s why the process to cancel your subscription is simple and straightforward.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I cancel my subscription?">
    To cancel your subscription, go to the "Manage Plan" area in your account settings and click the "Cancel My Plan" button. You’ll be asked a brief question about the reason for cancellation to help us improve.

    When you cancel, your access to the platform will continue until the end of the current billing period. For example, if you purchased an annual plan and cancel in the second month, you will still have full access to the tool until the end of the twelfth month. And if you purchased the monthly plan, it will also remain active for the remaining days of the month you paid for.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is there a trial period or satisfaction guarantee?">
    Yes, Tess AI offers a 7-day satisfaction guarantee for new users. During this period, you can test the platform and explore the available resources. If you’re not satisfied, you can request a full refund in an automated way within the 7-day period.
