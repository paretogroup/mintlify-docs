## Why Use Tess AI?

Unlike traditional chat tools that simply answer questions, Tess orchestrates collaboration between 250+ specialized AI models to generate superior quality outputs.

Think of Tess as a team of AI experts, each a specialist in their field—text, image, video, code, audio, etc.—working together in a coordinated way to complete tasks from start to finish, with up to 8x better performance than single-model platforms.

Traditional AI tools require constant supervision and manual intervention. You guide them step-by-step and then need to manually assemble the results. Tess AI works differently.

## Intelligent Model Orchestration

We believe that **no single AI is better than all of them working together.** Tess is not just a model aggregator—we are the orchestration layer that allows hundreds of specialized AIs to collaborate intelligently through a single interface.

When you request a task, Tess:

- Analyzes which model is best suited for each step
- Orchestrates collaboration between multiple specialized models
- Integrates the results into a cohesive and professional final output
- Result: Up to 8x higher performance in creative quality, task accuracy, and business insight generation.

## Unlimited Collaboration

We are the first AI platform with a shared wallet system. Instead of charging per user, we allow unlimited users per workspace — ideal for families, teams, and businesses.

## Total Transparency

Tess AI adopts a unique market positioning: we are committed to being the most transparent AI platform in the world – no hidden caps, no "fair use" clauses. With Tess AI, you:

- Know exactly how many credits you have purchased and can monitor your balance in real time in your AI Wallet.
- Are informed – before and after – of the concrete or estimated cost for executing each task.
- Have transparent pricing: our models are offered at the cost of the API + a 20% margin.

No surprises: no hidden limitations or unexpected account suspensions.
